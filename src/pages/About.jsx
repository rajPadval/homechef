      <p className="text-gray-700">
        HomeChef was born out of a passion for cooking and a desire to make meal
        planning easier for everyone. We understand the challenges of coming
        home after a long day and trying to figure out what to make for dinner
        with limited ingredients. That's why we created this platform â€“ to
        empower you to create amazing meals without the hassle of complicated
        grocery lists or last-minute runs to the store.
      </p>
      <h2>What We Offer</h2>
